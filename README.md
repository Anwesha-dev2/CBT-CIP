# 📘 CBT-CIP: C++ Beginner Projects

This repository contains two mini-projects written in C++ as part of the CBT-CIP (Code-Based Training – C++ Implementation Practice) series. These projects help strengthen fundamental programming concepts such as functions, conditionals, loops, input validation, and file handling (optional in future versions).

## 📂 Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Digital Calculator

A simple, menu-driven console calculator built in C++.

**🔧 Features:**
- Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Input validation to handle non-numeric values
- Division by zero handling
- Modular functions for each operation
- Repeats until the user exits the program

**🎯 Learning Focus:**
- Modular programming
- Switch-case control structure
- `cin.fail()` input validation
- Clean user interaction through loops

📁 File: `digital_calculator.cpp`

### 2️⃣ Student Record Management System

A basic console-based student record manager that simulates storing and displaying student data.

**🔧 Features:**
- Add and display student records
- Search for a student by roll number
- Delete student records (can be added in future)
- Menu-driven interface
- Uses structures or classes for data organization

**🎯 Learning Focus:**
- Structures / Classes in C++
- File I/O (optional in future)
- Conditionals and loop handling
- Real-life simulation of a CRUD system

📁 File: `student_record_management.cpp`
